# iGEM 2018 LUDOX OD calibration protocol

## Description:

With this protocol you will use LUDOX CL-X (a 45% colloidal silica suspension) as a single point reference to
obtain a conversion factor to transform absorbance (OD600) data from your plate reader into a comparable
OD600 measurement as would be obtained in a spectrophotometer. This conversion is necessary because plate
reader measurements of absorbance are volume dependent; the depth of the fluid in the well defines the path
length of the light passing through the sample, which can vary slightly from well to well. In a standard
spectrophotometer, the path length is fixed and is defined by the width of the cuvette, which is constant.
Therefore this conversion calculation can transform OD600 measurements from a plate reader (i.e. absorbance
at 600 nm, the basic output of most instruments) into comparable OD600 measurements. The LUDOX solution
is only weakly scattering and so will give a low absorbance value.

# Cell measurement protocol

## Description:
Prior to performing the cell measurements you should perform all three of
the calibration measurements. Please do not proceed unless you have
completed the three calibration protocols.
Completion of the calibrations will ensure that you understand the measurement process and that
you can take the cell measurements under the same conditions. For the sake of consistency and
reproducibility, we are requiring all teams to use E. coli K-12 DH5-alpha. If you do not have access to
this strain, you can request streaks of the transformed devices from another team near you, and this
can count as a collaboration as long as it is appropriately documented on both teams' wikis. If you
are absolutely unable to obtain the DH5-alpha strain, you may still participate in the InterLab study
by contacting the Measurement Committee (measurement at igem dot org) to discuss your
situation.
For all of these cell measurements, you must use the same plates and volumes that you used in your
calibration protocol. You must also use the same settings (e.g., filters or excitation and emission
wavelengths) that you used in your calibration measurements. If you do not use the same plates,
volumes, and settings, the measurements will not be valid.

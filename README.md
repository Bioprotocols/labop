Protocol Activity Modeling Language

# Installation

This repository contains a git submodule that is required for PAML to work.  When cloning the PAML repo, use:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/SD2E/paml.git
```

# API

To use PAML in your client application, go to the root directory of the project repository:
```
import paml
```
The API follows the same conventions as [OPIL](https://github.com/sd2e/opil).

# Running from the commandline

The PAML module can also be run as a commandline executable. Use these commandline options to generate documentation or print a summary report of the data model. See [OPIL](https://github.com/sd2e/opil).

# Split samples, dilute, and measure

## Description:

Subprotocol to split a portion of each sample in a plate into another plate, diluting 
with PBS, then measure OD and fluorescence from that other plate



## Protocol Inputs:
* Protocol input: [Growth Curve Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377): Samples to measure
* Protocol input: [PBS Source](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43169): Source for PBS


## Materials


## Containers
* [OD Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377) ([Microplate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377))


## Steps
1. Remove seal from [Growth Curve Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377)

2. Pipette 90.0 microliter of [Phosphate-Buffered Saline](https://identifiers.org/pubchem.substance:24978514) from [PBS Source](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43169) into [OD Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377)

3. Pipette 10.0 microliter from [Growth Curve Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377) into [OD Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377), mixing by pipetting up and down 10.0  times at destination

4. Measure fluorescence of [OD Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377) at excitation 488.0 nanometer and emission 530.0 nanometer with gain = 0.16 

5. Measure absorbance of [OD Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377) at 600.0 nanometer

6. Measure fluorescence of [OD Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377) at excitation 488.0 nanometer and emission 530.0 nanometer with gain = 0.2 

7. Measure fluorescence of [OD Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377) at excitation 488.0 nanometer and emission 530.0 nanometer with gain = 0.1 

8. Seal [Growth Curve Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377) with breathable seal

9. Cover [OD Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377)

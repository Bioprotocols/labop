# Split samples and measure, without dilution

## Description:

Subprotocol to split a portion of each sample in an unsealed plate into another plate, then measure OD and fluorescence from that other plate



## Protocol Inputs:
* Protocol input: [Overnight Growth Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377): Samples to measure


## Materials


## Containers
* [OD Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377) ([Microplate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377))


## Steps
1. Pipette 200.0 microliter from [Overnight Growth Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377) to [OD Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377)

2. Measure fluorescence of [OD Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377) at excitation 488.0 nanometer and emission 530.0 nanometer with gain = 0.2 

3. Measure fluorescence of [OD Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377) at excitation 488.0 nanometer and emission 530.0 nanometer with gain = 0.1 

4. Measure fluorescence of [OD Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377) at excitation 488.0 nanometer and emission 530.0 nanometer with gain = 0.16 

5. Measure absorbance of [OD Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377) at 600.0 nanometer

6. Cover [OD Plate](https://identifiers.org/ncit:C43377)

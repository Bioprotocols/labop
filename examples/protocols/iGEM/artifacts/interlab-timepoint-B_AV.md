# Experiment 3 - Cell measurement protocol Challenge

This year we plan to test protocols that will eventually be automated. For this reason, we will use 96-well plates instead of test tubes for culturing. Consequently, we want to evaluate how the performance of our plate culturing protocol compares to culturing in test tubes (e.g. 10 mL falcon tube) on a global scale. This version of the interlab protocol involves 2 hr. time interval measurements and incubation inside a microplate reader/incubator.

At the end of the experiment, you will have four plates to be measured. You will measure both fluorescence and absorbance in each plate.

Before performing the cell measurements, you need to perform all the calibration measurements. Please do not proceed unless you have completed the calibration protocol. Completion of the calibrations will ensure that you understand the measurement process and that you can take the cell measurements under the same conditions. For consistency and reproducibility, we are requiring all teams to use E. coli K-12 DH5-alpha. If you do not have access to this strain, you can request streaks of the transformed devices from another team near you. If you are absolutely unable to obtain the DH5-alpha strain, you may still participate in the InterLab study by contacting the Engineering Committee (engineering [at] igem [dot] org) to discuss your situation.

For all below indicated cell measurements, you must use the same type of plates and the same volumes that you used in your calibration protocol. You must also use the same settings (e.g., filters or excitation and emission wavelengths) that you used in your calibration measurements. If you do not use the same type of plates, volumes, and settings, the measurements will not be valid.

Protocol summary: UPDATE You will transform the eight devices listed in Table 1 into E. coli K-12 DH5-alpha cells. The next day you will pick two colonies from each transformation (16 total) and use them to inoculate 5 mL overnight cultures (this step is still in tubes). Each of these 16 overnight cultures will be used to inoculate four wells in a 96-well plate (200 microliter each, 4 replicates) and one test tube (12 mL). You will measure how fluorescence and optical density develops over 6 hours by taking measurements at time point 0 hour and at time point 6 hours. Follow the protocol below and the visual instructions in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

## Protocol Steps:
1. Obtain 8 x Petri dish containing LB Agar + Chloramphenicol growth medium for culturing `transformant strains`
2. Transform `Negative control (J428100)` DNA into _`E. coli`_ ` DH5 alpha`. Repeat for the remaining transformant DNA:  `Positive control (I20270)`, `Test Device 1 (J364000)`, `Test Device 2 (J364001)`, `Test Device 3 (J364002)`, `Test Device 4 (J364007)`, `Test Device 5 (J364008)`, and `Test Device 6 (J364009)`. Plate transformants on LB Agar + Chloramphenicol `transformant strains` plates. Incubate overnight (for 16 hour) at 37.0 degree Celsius.
3. Obtain 16 x culture tubes to contain `culture (day 1)`
4. Pick 2 colonies from each `transformant strains` plate.
5. Inoculate 2 colonies of each transformant strains, for a total of 16 cultures. Inoculate each into 5.0 milliliter of LB Broth+chloramphenicol in culture (day 1) and grow overnight (for 16.0 hour) at 37.0 degree Celsius and 220 rpm.
6. Obtain 16 x culture tubes to contain `culture (day 2)`
7. Dilute each of 16 `culture (day 1)` samples with LB Broth+chloramphenicol into the culture tube at a 1:10 ratio and final volume of 10.0 milliliter. Maintain at 4.0 degree Celsius while performing dilutions.
8. Obtain 16 x 1.5 mL microfuge tubes to contain `cultures (0 hr timepoint)`
9. Hold `cultures (0 hr timepoint)` at 4.0 degree Celsius. This will prevent cell growth while transferring samples.
10. Transfer 1.0 milliliter of each of 16 `culture (day 2)` samples to 1.5 mL microfuge tube containers to contain a total of 16 `cultures (0 hr timepoint)` samples. Maintain at 4.0 degree Celsius during transfer.
11. Measure baseline absorbance of culture (day 2) of `cultures (0 hr timepoint)` at 600.0 nanometer.
12. Obtain 16 x 50 ml conical tubes to contain `back-diluted culture` The conical tube should be opaque, amber-colored, or covered with foil.
13. Back-dilute each of 16 `culture (day 2)` samples to a target OD of 0.02 using LB Broth+chloramphenicol as diluent to a final volume of 40.0 milliliter. Maintain at 4.0 degree Celsius while performing dilutions.
14. Import data for `baseline absorbance of culture (day 2) measurements of cultures (0 hr timepoint)` into provided Excel file.

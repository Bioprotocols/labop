paml:SampleCollection a owl:Class ;

         acted upon by a Protocol. For example, a SampleCollection might describe a set of 10 cell cultures growing in
         96-well plate cells, or a set of 6 streaked agar plates, or a single 500 mL flask filled with media.

         There are two types of SampleCollection. A SampleArray specifies an n-dimensional rectangular array of samples,
         all stored in the same type of container. A SampleMask specifies a subset of a SampleCollection by means of an
         array of Boolean values indicating whether each element is included or excluded from the subset.

         Note, however, that a SampleCollection is a logical object and not a physical object. Thus, while a
         SampleCollection might describe a set of samples in 96-well plate wells, it does not necessarily identify
         a particular 96-well plate or the location of those wells.  In practice, these will be determined as a
         result of the specific library calls made to generate SampleCollection objects, and may not be determined
         until the protocol is actually run in a particular execution environment.

         This is important for increasing the flexibility with which a Protocol can be specified and applied.
         Consider, for example, a cell culturing protocol that includes a step to measure sample absorbance on a plate
         reader. Describing this step does not require knowing how the samples are laid out on the plate, and in many
         cases is even acceptable to run on samples across multiple plates. This flexibility will allow the cell
         culturing protocol to be applied for experiments with different numbers and arrangements of samples.""" ;

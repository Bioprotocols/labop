# Using the three color calibration protocol: Does the order of transcritional units influence their expression strength?

In this experiment, your team will measure the fluorescence of six devices that encode two fluorescence proteins in two transcriptional units. The devices differ in the order of the transcriptional units. You will calibrate the fluorescence of these devices to the calibrant dyes and the optical density of the culture to the cell density calibrant.

This experiment aims to assess the lab-to-lab reproducibility of the three color calibration protocol when two fluorescent proteins are expressed in the same cell. Besides this technical question, it also adresses a fundamental synthetic biology question: does the order of the transcritional units (that encode for the two different fluorescent proteins) on the devices influence their expression levels?
